## Introduction

This project was built to develop my front-end skills; including using HTML, CSS and to consider responsiveness, accessibility and the UX.  

The website contains four simple pages; the main homepage, my projects, an 'about me' section and a 'contact me' page.
I used @media to help with the responsive web design, enabled skip to content links, alt text for images and thought carefully about the contrast between colours in both light and dark modes.
